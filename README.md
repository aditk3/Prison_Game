# Prison Game

The basic concept of this game is that you are a supervillain trying to escape a max security prison. The game type will be roguelike and the enemies/items will spawn in predetermined locations so that the player can continuously improve on the game from previous attempts. 
The player will be able to push away enemies with a melee attack, but will be unable to deal damage to other enemies than the final boss, to make the game more stealth and movement focused. 

There will be various buttons, levers, parkour, etc in the level that the player will interact with to find the escape to the prison or the next floor of the level. The game will also have 4 classes of enemy types with a patrol guard, a shooting guard(mortar), scared prisoner, and a final boss/warden.

In the Final submission, we have updated the game with finished assets and materials, as well as implement a full inventory system, full dashes, crouches, and melee combat, as well as a level that requires all three abilities to finish, and terrifying enemies that can kill you very easily. The game has the roguelike aesthetic in that you have a lot of mobility and moving around enemies is your best friend, as well as exploring the map to find the hidden keys and helpful items that can aid your journey.
